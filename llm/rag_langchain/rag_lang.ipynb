(~FreeBirD®~/flickr)\\nOrigins of the Indus Valley Civilization\\n\\n\\nThe earliest evidence of humans in South Asia dates back two million years. Beginning about 30,000 years ago, stone age hunters and gatherers inhabited sites in the area. Between 8000 and 6500 B.C.E., there was a gradual shift from dependence on wild resources to domestic plants and animals.\\n\\nDuring the period between 5000 and 2000 B.C.E., highly organized urban settlements spread throughout northern regions (present-day Pakistan and north India). Trade and communication networks linked these settlements to one another and to other distant ancient cultures.\\n\\nIndus Valley Civilization and the Rise of Indo-Aryan Culture\\n\\nAround 2600 B.C.E., regional cultures were united into a culturally integrated network in the Indus Valley region. Settlements in this civilization extended over a 650,000 square kilometer region. The peoples of the region shared a number of cultural characteristics, including planned urban developments, the use of a still undeciphered script, standardized weights, and craft technologies.\\n\\nThe Indus Valley cultural system declined in the early centuries of the second millennium B.C.E., probably due to environmental changes in the region. Around 1500, Indo-Aryan culture began to dominate the region. Indo-Aryan culture is associated with Sanskrit, a language related to Greek, Latin, and Avestan (the ancient language of Persia)--all are derivatives of a common mother language that is no longer extant (named by linguists as proto-Indo European). The Veda--texts associated with the complex ritual system of the Indo-Aryans--were composed in this period. These texts formed one important basis for the religion we now call \"Hinduism.\"\\n\\nThe Early and Classical Periods\\n\\nAt first largely nomadic, Indo Aryan culture became increasingly urbanized and settled. New religious orientations arose, and some of the notions associated with classical Hinduism and the other major religions of the period--such as samsara, or the notion of rebirth--developed. Buddhism and Jainism were founded in the middle of the last millennium B.C.E., sharing some of the basic assumptions of developing Hindu thought but critical of the hierarchical and ritual system associated with the Vedic system. Centralized power was first established on a broad scale under the Nanda dynasty in Magadha, and then expanded under the Mauryas from ca. 323-184 B.C.E.\\n\\nIn the first century C.E., the Kushans, a group of nomadic warriors from central Asia, conquered the Gandharan region of northern India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Smaller regional centers across the North, under Kushana control in the early centuries of the first millennium, were brought together under Gupta control in the fourth century. The Gupta period was characterized by great flourishing of art and literature, and is known as the \"classical\" period of Indian art and literature.\\n\\nThe \"Medieval\" Period\\n\\nThis period was characterized by the growth of strong regional centers and lack of one overarching political authority in the subcontinent. Sind in present-day Pakistan was integrated into a Muslim polity to the west; invasions by Turkic and Central Asian rulers commenced at the beginning of the second millennium C.E. Centralized powers were established, based at Delhi; independent regional kingdoms, however, continued. By the time Turkish invaders had established their power over the north as sultans, Rajput rulers in present-day Rajasthan and Punjab had established powerful small kingdoms. Regional kingdoms also flourished in the south.\\n\\nThe Mughals\\n\\nIn 1526, the Mughal empire was founded by Babur, a Turkish/Central Asian chieftain whose ancestors included Chingiz Khan an Timur (known in the West as Tamarlane). His son Humayan was driven from India in 1540 and took refuge in the court of Shah Tahmasp in Iran. Mughal rule was reestablished, and under Akbar expanded across the north. Akbar moved against Rajput rulers, who were allowed to retain control over their land in exchange for their loyalty. The Rajput hill-states of the Punjab hills (now Himachal Pradesh) were brought under Mughal influence under the rule of Jahangir, Akbar\\'s son.\\n\\nBritish Rule\\n\\nAlthough Europeans were present in South Asia as traders from the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that the British established rule in the region. As Mughal control waned in the eighteenth century, British power expanded. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British were ceded control of the province of Bengal. By 1857, the time of the First War of Indian Independence (or, as it was known to the British at the time, the \"Mutiny\"), the British were poised to take control from Mughal hands permanently. Nearly two-fifths of the area, however, was left in the hands of quasi-independent rulers, who nonetheless were forced to contend with British power at the center.\\n\\nThe Modern Nation-States of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal\\n\\nIn 1947, the independent nations of Pakistan (East and West) and India were formed out of the British empire in India; Nepal was never integrated into this empire. The partition of the subcontinent into separate nation-states is accompanied by tremendous violence. In 1971, East and West Pakistan divided into Pakistan and Bangladesh. Although relations among these nation-states are often tense, they share many cultural, as well as historical, ties. South Asians in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and other parts of Asia form a dynamic Diaspora community.\\n\\nAuthor: Anne Murphy.\\n\\nAbout\\nAbout Asia Society\\nWhat We Do\\nSupport\\nMembership\\nCareers\\nInterns and Volunteers\\nfor the media\\nPress Releases and News\\nour locations\\nHong Kong\\nNew York\\nTexas\\nAustralia\\nFrance\\nIndia\\nJapan\\nKorea\\nNorthern California\\nPhilippines\\nSeattle\\nSouthern California\\nSwitzerland\\nWashington, D.C.\\nour pillars\\nArts\\nEducation\\nPolicy\\ninitiatives\\nArts & Museum Summit\\nAsia 21 Next Generation Fellows\\nAsia Arts Game Changer Awards\\nAsia Game Changer Awards\\nAsia Society Policy Institute\\nAsian Women Empowered\\nCenter on U.S.-China Relations\\nCoal + Ice\\nCreative Voices of Muslim Asia\\nGlobal Cities Education Network\\nGlobal Talent Initiatives\\nU.S.-Asia Entertainment Summit\\nConnect\\n.

Archaeological studies have shown that there is a continuity in Indian civilization that goes back to at least 8000 B.C.  DNA studies from the Rakhigarhi excavations in Haryana, which is the largest site of the Harappan Civilization located almost in the middle of the Saraswati river basin in the Indus Valley Civilization,  have shown that the site was under occupation from Early Harappan (5500 BCE-2600 BCE) to  Mature Harappan (2600 BCE-1900 BCE)  period. The Indian rock art has even longer prehistory; several rock paintings sites in India are estimated to be about 40,000-10000 years old.  The Advisory Body Evaluation (ICOMOS) report of UNESCO for Rock shelters of Bhimbetka (cave paintings) in India, which is a UNESCO world heritage site, states that in at least one of the excavated shelters, it is said in the nomination that continued occupation is demonstrable from 100,000 BCE (Late Acheulian) to 1000 AD. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Indus Valley Civilization, which was initially thought to consist of cities based along the Indus River, is now thought to have been located in a much wider area. This is due to a number of new sites discovered in recent years far away from the Indus River. The location of new sites along a dried up river bed, much wider than the present stream in that region, alongwith other multi-disciplinary research has given credence to the theory of a lost mega river, Saraswati, which is described in the Rigveda (the oldest book in the human library) as a large river of the Vedic Civilization.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Indus Valley Civilization was one of the first large-scale urban societies of the ancient world, characterized by systematic town planning, elaborate drainage systems, granaries and standardization of weights and measures. The inhabitants of this civilization were cosmopolitan, with inhabinants living together in large regional urban centers like Harappa (Punjab), Mohenjodaro (Sindh), Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Dholavira (Kutch/Gujarat), and Ganweriwala (Cholistan). The mounds of Bhirrana village on the banks of Ghaggar river in Fatehabad district of Haryana date back to 7500-6200 BCE and are considered to be the oldest Harappan site.   Recent DNA studies from Rakhigarhi  site  have set aside the earlier hypothesis about mass human migration/Aryan migration from outside the South Asia and establish that the hunter gatherers in Indian sub continent have independent origin, that the people of the Harappan Culture are the ancestors of the most of the population of South Asia and give rise to a new Out of India hypotheses implying that there was a movement of the people from South Asia to West bringing with them the Indian languages.  The Harappan people’s presence is evident at sites like Gonur in Turkmenistan and Sahr-i-Sokhta in Iran. The Vedic civilization, the time when Vedas were composed, is thought to be the same as the Harappan Civilization.\\n\\n \\n\\nAt the time when Harappan Culture was thriving,  other parts of the Indian sub continent were inhabited too.  Sanauli burial sites in the Uttar Pradesh state of India have yielded chariots engraved with copper, and are estimated to be about 4000 years old. Keeladi excavations in Tamil Nadu, a state in south of India, are estimated to be from 6th century BCE and suggest that the urbanisation of Vaigai plains happened in Tamil Nadu around the same time as the Gangetic plains.\\n\\n \\n\\nHistory cannot yet say exactly why the Harappan culture disappeared, however experts are coming around to the view that the drying of ‘lost’ Saraswati river, the preeminent river of Rig-Vedic times,  as a result of tectonic upheavals led to gradual shifting away of inhabitants from these cities  along the river.  Around 6th Century BCE, great philosophers  like Vardhaman Mahavira and Gautama Buddha  captivated India with their teachings, whose followers converted their thoughts into the separate religions of Jainism and Buddhism respectively.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe history of India is the history of the rise and fall of many empires, most indigenous, some established by invaders who came to conquer and ended up being absorbed into the Indian mainstream, contributing to the diversity of Indian culture today. The empires mentioned in the Epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata were centred in the North of India and the capitals of the great dynastic empires of ancient India were in the area today covered by the state of Bihar. These dynasties included the Nandas (3nd century BC) who stopped Alexander the Great from entering the Gangetic plain (326-325 BC), the Mauryas (2nd – 1st century BC) whose zenith was the empire of Ashoka, and the Guptas (4th century AD) in whose time Kautilya wrote the famous Arthshastra. Cities like Magadha and Pataliputra were developed, prosperous centres of commerce, culture and learning, and their fame spread far and wide.   The last great empire in this period of Indian history was that of Harsha in the 7th century AD.     India was the centre of learning in the world as students from many countries flocked to the famed universities like Nalanda, Vikramshila and Taxila.  \\n\\n \\n\\nAt the same time, the glory of India’s cultural and civilizational treasures were nurtured and spread across much of South East Asia and South Asia by the empires in the south of India.  Prominent among these empires included the Vijayanagara empire, Chola (300 BCE-1279 CE.  One of the longest ruling dynasties in the world’s history. During the reign of Rajaraja Chola I and his successor Rajendra Chola I,  the Chola navy dominated  a large part of Southeast Asia),  Pandyan, Chera, etc.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe heyday of invasions was in what is today classified as Medieval India, when the Turks and the Mongols penetrated into India from the North in waves beginning in the 11th century which ultimately culminated in the establishment of the Mughal empire (1526 to 1857), and the Portuguese (Vasco de Gama landed at Calicut (Kozhikode) in 1498 with the help of an Indian trader who brought him to India from the eastern seaboard of Africa), the Dutch, the French and the British followed using the sea routes which allowed them to enter India, initially as traders and later as colonisers.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe British overcame indigenous resistance (beginning with the Battle of Plassey in 1757) and French competition (the first Anglo-French war was fought in 1748) to annex most of India, especially after the end of the First War of Independence in 1857 when the British Crown took over the government of British India from the East India Company. The British ruled India till 1947, when those fighting for India’s independence achieved their goal, and Mahatma Gandhi was immortalised for having formulated the path of non-violent resistance.\\n\\nTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyHyperlinking PolicyAccessibility StatementHelp\\nCopyright © 2024 Embassy of India, Budapest, Hungary.

It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country from June 2023 onwards;[22][23] and since its independence in 1947, the world\\'s most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.\\n\\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, predominantly in isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its hymns recorded the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] India\\'s pre-existing Dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions.[36] By 400 BCE, caste had emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires.[39] Widespread creativity suffused this era,[40] but the status of women declined,[41] and untouchability became an organized belief.[l][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]\\n\\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[44] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains.[45] The resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[46] In south India, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[47] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[48] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[49] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][50] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[51] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[52][53] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[54] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement, noted for nonviolent resistance, became the major factor in ending British rule.[55][56] In 1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[57][58][59][60] a Hindu-majority dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition.[61]\\n\\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023.[62] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[63] India has become a fast-growing major economy and hub for information technology services; it has an expanding middle class.[64] Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture.[65] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[66] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[67] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[68] and rising levels of air pollution.[69] India\\'s land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[70] India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[71] is supported in protected habitats.\\n\\nEtymology\\nMain article: Names for India\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary (2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India (Ἰνδία), Ancient Greek Indos (Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \\'river\\'—specifically the Indus River, and by extension its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The Ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, \\'the people of the Indus\\'.[74]\\n\\nThe term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] ⓘ), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\n\\nHindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] ⓘ) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80] and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing the northern Indian subcontinent (present-day northern India and Pakistan) or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India\\nAncient India\\n\\nManuscript illustration, c.\\u20091650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.\\u2009400 BCE – c.\\u2009300 CE[82]\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]\\n\\nDuring the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91]\\n\\n\\nCave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves\\nIn the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka\\'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[102][103]\\n\\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[108]\\n\\nMedieval India\\nMain article: Medieval India\\n\\nBrihadeshwara temple, Thanjavur, completed in 1010 CE\\n\\nThe Qutub Minar, 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]\\n\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[113] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[115] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115]\\n\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[117][118] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120] The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]\\n\\nEarly modern India\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[127] The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]\\n\\n\\nA distant view of the Taj Mahal from the Agra Fort\\n\\nA two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed \"William IIII, King\"\\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[134][135] The East India Company\\'s control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[139] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India\\'s colonial period.[134] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[140]\\n\\nModern India\\nMain article: History of India (1947–present)\\nHistorians consider India\\'s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[141][142][143][144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[145][146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[149][150][151][152]\\n\\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[153] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[155] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[157] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[156]\\n\\n\\n1909 map of the British Indian Empire\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946\\nAfter World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[158] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[159] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[160] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress\\'s final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[161]\\n\\nVital to India\\'s self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic republic.[162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[163] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world\\'s fastest-growing economies,[164] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[165] by religious and caste-related violence;[166] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[167] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[168] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[169] and with Pakistan.[169] India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[170]\\n\\nGeography\\nMain article: Geography of India\\nIndia accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.[171] India\\'s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[171] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[171] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth\\'s mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[171] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[172] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[173] The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis.[174][175][176]\\n\\n\\nThe Tungabhadra, with rocky outcrops, flows into the peninsular Krishna River.[177]\\n\\nFishing boats lashed together in a tidal creek in Anjarle village, Maharashtra\\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[178] To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats;[179] the plateau contains the country\\'s oldest rock formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35° 30′ north latitude[n] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[180]\\n\\nIndia\\'s coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains.[181] According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.[181]\\n\\nMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal.[182] Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter\\'s extremely low gradient, caused by long-term silt deposition, leads to severe floods and course changes.[183][184] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal;[185] and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea.[186] Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[187] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India\\'s south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.[188]\\n\\nIndian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[189] The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes.[190][191] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India\\'s rainfall.[189] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.[192]\\n\\nTemperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[193] Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause. The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers, including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[194] According to some current projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[195]\\n\\nBiodiversity\\nMain articles: Forestry in India and Wildlife of India\\nIndia is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[196] India is the habitat for 8.6% of all mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the world\\'s 34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[o][200]\\n\\nIndia\\'s most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and Northeast India, occupy approximately 3% of its land area.[201][202] Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India\\'s land area.[201][202] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[203] India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible.[204]\\n\\nAmong the Indian subcontinent\\'s notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine,[205] and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[206] which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro,[207] and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment.[208]\\n\\nMany Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago.[209] India\\'s subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[210] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the Himalayas.[211] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India\\'s mammals, which stands at 12.6%, contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198] Among endemics are the vulnerable[212] hooded leaf monkey[213] and the threatened Beddome\\'s toad[214][215] of the Western Ghats.\\n\\nIndia contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms.[216] These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin. Critically endangered species include the gharial, a crocodilian; the great Indian bustard; and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.[217] Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement, the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah; the blackbuck, no longer extant in Punjab, is now severely endangered in India, and the cheetah is extinct.[218] The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife. In response, the system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was expanded substantially. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act[219] and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness; the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988.[220] India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves,[221] four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; its eigthy-nine wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[222]\\n\\nIndia has the majority of the world\\'s wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[223]\\nIndia has the majority of the world\\'s wild tigers, approximately 3,170 in 2022.[223]\\n \\nA chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[p] forest.\\nA chital (Axis axis) stag in the Nagarhole National Park in a region covered by a moderately dense[p] forest.\\n \\nThree of the last Asiatic cheetahs in India were shot dead in 1948 in Surguja district, Madhya Pradesh, Central India by Maharajah Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo.

V.[224]\\nA parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[225] India has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 50 regional parties.[226] The Congress is considered center in Indian political culture,[227] and the BJP right-wing.[228][229][230] For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the Parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[231] as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalition governments at the center.[232]\\n\\nIn the Republic of India\\'s first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru\\'s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Nehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; Morarji Desai and Charan Singh. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar.[233] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.[234]\\n\\n\\nUS president Barack Obama addresses the members of the Parliament of India in New Delhi in November 2010.\\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two comparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended on external support. There were two prime ministers during this period; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition government to complete a five-year term.[235] Again in the 2004 Indian general elections, no party won an absolute majority, but the Congress emerged as the largest single party, forming another successful coalition: the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). It had the support of left-leaning parties and MPs who opposed the BJP. The UPA returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers, and it no longer required external support from India\\'s communist parties.[236] That year, Manmohan Singh became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re-elected to a consecutive five-year term.[237] In the 2014 general election, the BJP became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties.[238] In the 2019 general election, the BJP was victorious again with majority. In the 2024 general election, the BJP failed to achieve majority and the BJP-led NDA coalition formed the government. Narendra Modi, a former chief minister of Gujarat, is serving as the prime minister of India in his third term since May 26, 2014.[239]\\n\\nGovernment\\nMain articles: Government of India and Constitution of India\\n\\nRashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the Viceroy of India, and constructed between 1911 and 1931 during the British Raj.[240]\\nIndia is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country\\'s supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[241] originally stated India to be a \"democratic republic;\" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to a \"socialist, secular, democratic republic\".[242] India\\'s form of government, traditionally described as \"quasi-federal\" with a strong centre and weak states,[243] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[244][245]\\n\\nThe Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary.[246] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,[247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.[248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.[250] Appointed by the president,[251] the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.[250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.[247] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them.[252]\\n\\nThe legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).[253] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years.[254] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state\\'s share of the national population.[251] The Lok Sabha\\'s 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18;[255] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.[256] The Indian constitution historically allowed for the nomination of Anglo-Indians to two seats in the Lok Sabha; this provision was removed in 2019.[255][257] A number of seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state.[255]\\n\\nIndia has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[258] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.[258] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.[259] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[260] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.[261]\\n\\nAdministrative divisions\\nMain article: Administrative divisions of India\\nSee also: Political integration of India\\n\\nA clickable map of the 28 states and 8 union territories of India\\nIndia is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.[12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[262] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[263]\\n\\nStates\\nAndhra Pradesh\\nArunachal Pradesh\\nAssam\\nBihar\\nChhattisgarh\\nGoa\\nGujarat\\nHaryana\\nHimachal Pradesh\\nJharkhand\\nKarnataka\\nKerala\\nMadhya Pradesh\\nMaharashtra\\nManipur\\nMeghalaya\\nMizoram\\nNagaland\\nOdisha\\nPunjab\\nRajasthan\\nSikkim\\nTamil Nadu\\nTelangana\\nTripura\\nUttar Pradesh\\nUttarakhand\\nWest Bengal\\nUnion territories\\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands\\nChandigarh\\nDadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu\\nJammu and Kashmir\\nLadakh\\nLakshadweep\\nNational Capital Territory of Delhi\\nPuducherry\\nForeign, economic, and strategic relations\\nMain articles: Foreign relations of India and Indian Armed Forces\\n\\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, India played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[264] From left to right: Gamal Abdel Nasser of United Arab Republic (now Egypt), Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and Jawaharlal Nehru in Belgrade, September 1961.\\nIndia became a republic in 1950 and chose to stay in the Commonwealth of Nations.[265][266] Throughout the decade, India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia and played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement.[267] After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went to war with China in 1962 and was widely thought to have been humiliated.[268] This was followed by another military conflict in 1967 in which India successfully repelled Chinese attack.[269] India has had tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan. The two have gone to war four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the third, the 1971 war, followed from India\\'s support for the independence of Bangladesh.[270] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d\\'état attempt in the Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[271]\\n\\nAside from its ongoing special relationship with Russia,[272] India has wide-ranging defence relations with Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 military and police personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[273] India has close economic ties with countries in South America,[274] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a \"Look East\" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with the ASEAN nations, Japan, and South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those involving economic investment and regional security.[275][276]\\n\\n\\nThe Indian Air Force contingent marching at the 221st Bastille Day military parade in Paris, on 14 July 2009.

Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory.[279] India maintains a \"no first use\" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its \"Minimum Credible Deterrence\" doctrine.[280][281] It is developing a ballistic missile defence shield and, a fifth-generation fighter jet.[282][283] Other indigenous military projects involve the design and implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class nuclear submarines.[284]\\n\\nIndia is estimated to possess up to 172 nuclear warheads, and is considered to be producing both highly enriched uranium (HEU) and weapons-grade plutonium, with its HEU production assumed to be focused on its growing number of nuclear-powered vessels\\' and submarines\\' fuels.[285][286] Kristensen et al. of Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists estimate that India is operating eight nuclear-capable systems as of 2024, including aircraft, land-based and sea-based ballistic missile systems, with most of its programs in development thought to be nearing \"completion and to be fielded with the armed forces soon\".[285]\\n\\nSince the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union.[287] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India\\'s nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[288] India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[289] France,[290] the United Kingdom,[291] and Canada.[292]\\n\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India (left, background) in talks with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico during a visit to Mexico, 2016\\nThe President of India is the supreme commander of the nation\\'s armed forces; with 1.45 million active troops, they compose the world\\'s second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard.[293] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion, or 1.83% of GDP.[294] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous fiscal year.[295][296] India is the world\\'s second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports.[297] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[298] In May 2017, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the South Asia Satellite, a gift from India to its neighbouring SAARC countries.[299] In October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia\\'s most advanced long-range missile defence system.[300]\\n\\nEconomy\\nMain article: Economy of India\\n\\nA farmer in northwestern Karnataka ploughs his field with a tractor even as another in a field beyond does the same with a pair of oxen.

Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[308] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[309][310] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[311] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.[312]\\n\\nThe 522-million-worker Indian labour force is the world\\'s second largest, as of 2017.[293] The service sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India\\'s foreign exchange remittances of US$100 billion in 2022,[313] highest in the world, were contributed to its economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[314] Major agricultural products include rice, wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[12] Major industries include textiles, telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[12] In 2006, the share of external trade in India\\'s GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[309] In 2008, India\\'s share of world trade was 1.7%;[315] In 2021, India was the world\\'s ninth-largest importer and the sixteenth-largest exporter.[316] Major exports include petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and manufactured leather goods.[12] Major imports include crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and chemicals.[12] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from 14% to 42%.[317] India was the world\\'s second-largest textile exporter after China in the 2013 calendar year.[318]\\n\\nAveraging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior to 2007,[309] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates during the first decade of the 21st century.[319] Some 431 million Indians have left poverty since 1985; India\\'s middle classes are projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[320] Though ranking 68th in global competitiveness,[321] as of 2010, India ranks 17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector, 44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of several advanced economies.[322] With seven of the world\\'s top 15 information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as of 2009, the country is viewed as the second-most favourable outsourcing destination after the United States.[323] India is ranked 39th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[324] In 2023, India\\'s consumer market was the world\\'s fifth largest.[325]\\n\\nDriven by growth, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita increased steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$2,731 in 2024. It is expected to grow to US$3,264 by 2026.[17] However, it has remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, and is expected to remain so in the near future.\\n\\n\\nA panorama of Bengaluru, the centre of India\\'s software development economy. In the 1980s, when the first multinational corporations began to set up centres in India, they chose Bengaluru (then called Bangalore) because of the large pool of skilled graduates in the area, in turn due to the many science and engineering colleges in the surrounding region.[326]\\nAccording to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report, India\\'s GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the United States by 2045.[327] During the next four decades, Indian GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy until 2050.[327] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle-class.[327] The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.[328]\\n\\nAccording to the Worldwide Cost of Living Report released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in 2017, which compared more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services, four of the cheapest cities were in India: Bengaluru (3rd), Mumbai (5th), Chennai (5th) and New Delhi (8th).[329]\\n\\nIndustries\\n\\nA tea garden in Sikkim.

The number of people living in urban areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[365] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural areas.[366][367] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[368] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[369] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males.[370] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of urban areas.[368] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while Bihar the least with 63.82%.[370]\\n\\n\\nThe interior of San Thome Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

India has no national language.[371] Hindi, with the largest number of speakers, is the official language of the government.[372][373] English is used extensively in business and administration and has the status of a \"subsidiary official language\";[6] it is important in education, especially as a medium of higher education. Each state and union territory has one or more official languages, and the constitution recognises in particular 22 \"scheduled languages\".\\n\\nThe 2011 census reported the religion in India with the largest number of followers was Hinduism (79.80% of the population), followed by Islam (14.23%); the remaining were Christianity (2.30%), Sikhism (1.72%), Buddhism (0.70%), Jainism (0.36%) and others[r] (0.9%).[11] India has the third-largest Muslim population—the largest for a non-Muslim majority country.[374][375]\\n\\nCulture\\nMain article: Culture of India\\n\\nA Sikh pilgrim at the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, in Amritsar, Punjab\\nIndian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[376] During the Vedic period (c.\\u20091700 BCE – c.\\u2009500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[74] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation\\'s major religions.[377] The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[378] the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement,[377] and by Buddhist philosophy.[379]\\n\\nVisual art\\nMain article: Indian art\\nIndia has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[380] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The \"Pashupati\" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[381][382] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[382][383] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[384][385][386] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[387] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana (\"breath\" or life-force).[388][389] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[390][391]\\n\\nMost of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[392] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[393][394] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[395] Gupta art, at its peak c.\\u2009300 CE – c.\\u2009500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[396][397] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c.\\u2009800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[398] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[399][400]\\n\\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[401][402] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[403] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[404][405] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[406][407] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[408][409] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[410][411]\\n\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century CE\\nBhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist reliefs from Mathura, 2nd century CE\\n \\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\nGupta terracotta relief, Krishna Killing the Horse Demon Keshi, 5th century\\n \\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, 18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c.\\u2009550\\n \\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\\nChola bronze of Shiva as Nataraja (\"Lord of Dance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th or 11th century\\n \\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c.\\u20091635\\nJahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign, Balchand, c.\\u20091635\\n \\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra painting, 1775–1785\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of India\\n\\nThe Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river showing two outlying red sandstone buildings, a mosque on the right (west) and a jawab (response) thought to have been built for architectural balance\\nMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported styles.[412] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its flavours. Vastu shastra, literally \"science of construction\" or \"architecture\" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan,[413] explores how the laws of nature affect human dwellings;[414] it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs.[415] As applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the \"absolute\".[416] The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by orders of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world\\'s heritage\".[417] Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.[418]\\n\\nLiterature\\nMain article: Indian literature\\nThe earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the Sanskrit language.[419] Major works of Sanskrit literature include the Rigveda (c.\\u20091500 BCE – c.\\u20091200 BCE), the epics: Mahābhārata (c.\\u2009400 BCE – c.\\u2009400 CE) and the Ramayana (c.\\u2009300 BCE and later); Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of Kālidāsa (c.\\u20095th century CE) and Mahākāvya poetry.[420][421][422] In Tamil literature, the Sangam literature (c.\\u2009600 BCE – c.\\u2009300 BCE) consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[423][424][425][426] From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India\\'s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.[427] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Rabindranath Tagore,[428] who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\n\\nPerforming arts and media\\nMain articles: Music of India, Dance in India, Cinema of India, and Television in India\\n\\nIndia\\'s National Academy of Performance Arts has recognised eight Indian dance styles to be classical. One such is Kuchipudi shown here.\\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindustani and the southern Carnatic schools.[429] Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known folk dances are: bhangra of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India\\'s National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.[430]\\n\\nTheatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[431] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes: the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[432] India has a theatre training institute, the National School of Drama (NSD), in New Delhi.[433] The Indian film industry produces the world\\'s most-watched cinema.[434] Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.[435] The Hindi language film industry (Bollywood) is the largest sector representing 43% of box office revenue, followed by the South Indian Telugu and Tamil film industries which represent 36% combined.[436]\\n\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication and expanded slowly for more than two decades.[437][438] The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then, satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian society.[439] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).[440]\\n\\nSociety\\n\\nMuslims offer namaz at a mosque in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.\\nTraditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or \"castes\".[441] India abolished untouchability in 1950 with the adoption of the constitution and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.\\n\\nFamily values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-generational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in India, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[442] An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders.[443] Marriage is thought to be for life,[443] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[444] with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[445] Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[446] Female infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster than the population growth during the same period.[447] According to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do not receive adequate care.[448] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[449] The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[450] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[451]\\n\\nMany Indian festivals are religious in origin. The best known include Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[452][453]\\n\\nEducation\\nMain articles: Education in India, Literacy in India, and History of education in the Indian subcontinent\\n\\nChildren awaiting school lunch in Rayka (also Raika), a village in rural Gujarat. The salutation Jai Bhim written on the blackboard honours the jurist, social reformer, and Dalit leader B. R. Ambedkar.\\nIn the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[454][455] According to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.[456]\\n\\nThe education system of India is the world\\'s second-largest.[457] India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[458] and 1.5 million schools.[459] In India\\'s higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India\\'s improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[460][461]\\n\\nClothing\\nMain article: Clothing in India\\n\\nWomen in sari at an adult literacy class in Tamil Nadu\\n\\nA man in dhoti and wearing a woollen shawl, in Varanasi\\nFrom ancient times until the advent of the modern, the most widely worn traditional dress in India was draped.[462] For women it took the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many yards long.[462] The sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder.[462] In its modern form, it is combined with an underskirt, or Indian petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening. It is also commonly worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which serves as the primary upper-body garment, the sari\\'s end—passing over the shoulder—covering the midriff and obscuring the upper body\\'s contours.[462] For men, a similar but shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[463]\\n\\nThe use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi sultanate (c.\\u20091300 CE) and then continued by the Mughal Empire (c.\\u20091525 CE).[464] Among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers, and the tunics kurta and kameez.[464] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use.[464]\\n\\n\\nWomen (from left to right) in churidars and kameez (with back to the camera), jeans and sweater, and pink shalwar kameez\\nSalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom. They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated around the waist.[465] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[466] its side seams left open below the waistline.[467] The kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearer\\'s knees.[468]\\n\\nIn the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India. Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[469] The traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who favour churidars or jeans.[469] In office settings, ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[469] For weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often wear bandgala, or short Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars.[469] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[470] is seldom seen in the cities.[469]\\n\\nCuisine\\nMain article: Indian cuisine\\n\\nSouth Indian vegetarian thali, or platter\\n\\nRailway mutton curry from Odisha\\nThe foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[471] The cooked cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread;[472] the idli, a steamed breakfast cake; or dosa, a griddled pancake.[473] The savoury dishes might include lentils, pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with ginger and garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamon and others.[471] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of cooking.[474]\\n\\nA platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments. The cereal and its accompaniments are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding, wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables.[471]\\n\\nDuration: 14 seconds.0:14\\nA tandoor chef in the Turkman Gate, Old Delhi, makes Khameeri roti (a Muslim-influenced style of leavened bread).[475]\\nIndia has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents.[476] The appearance of ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in Indian history, especially Upanishadic Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, is thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India\\'s Hindu population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as among Jains.[476] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[477] Unlike China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption.[478]\\n\\nThe most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the last millennium occurred during the Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the pilaf,[479] developed in the Abbasid caliphate,[480] and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern India from regions to its northwest.[481] To the simple yogurt marinade of Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in India.[481] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become biryani,[481] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[482] In the food served in Indian restaurants worldwide the diversity of Indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of Punjabi cuisine. The popularity of tandoori chicken—cooked in the tandoor oven, which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural Punjab and the Delhi region, especially among Muslims, but which is originally from Central Asia—dates to the 1950s, and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been displaced by the 1947 partition.[476]\\n\\nSports and recreation\\nMain article: Sport in India\\nSee also: Indian physical culture\\n\\nGirls play hopscotch in Jaora, Madhya Pradesh. Hopscotch has been commonly played by girls in rural India.[483]\\nSeveral traditional sports—such as kabaddi, kho kho, pehlwani, gilli-danda, hopscotch and martial arts such as Kalarippayattu and marma adi—remain popular. Chess is commonly held to have originated in India as chaturaṅga;[484] in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of Indian grandmasters,[485] and world champions.[486] Parcheesi is derived from Pachisi, another traditional Indian pastime, which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by Mughal emperor Akbar the Great.[487]\\n\\nCricket is the most popular sport in India.[488] India has won two Cricket World Cups, the 1983 edition and the 2011 edition. India has won eight field hockey gold medals in the summer Olympics.[489] India has participated in shooting sports and has won several medals at the Olympics, the World Shooting Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.[490][491] Other sports in which Indians have succeeded internationally include badminton,[492] boxing,[493] and wrestling.[494] Football is popular in West Bengal, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the north-eastern states. The major domestic league is the Indian Premier League. Professional leagues in other sports include the Indian Super League (football) and the Pro Kabaddi League.[495][496][497]\\n\\nSee also\\nAdministrative divisions of India\\nOutline of India\\nPortals:\\nflag India\\nicon Countries\\nicon Asia\\nNotes\\n Originally written in Sanskritised Bengali and adopted as the national anthem in its Hindi translation\\n \"[...] Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations in the words as the Government may authorise as occasion arises; and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it.\"[5]\\n Written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Sanskritised Bengali\\n According to Part XVII of the Constitution of India, Hindi in the Devanagari script is the official language of the Union, along with English as an additional official language.[1][6][7] States and union territories can have a different official language of their own other than Hindi or English.\\n Not all the state-level official languages are in the eighth schedule and not all the scheduled languages are state-level official languages.

This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is in fact something of a tape-recording of ca. 1500–500 BCE.

The culture is called Aryan, and evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and Artharva).\";\\n(d) Dyson 2018, pp. 14–15, \"Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an \\'Aryan invasion\\' it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European language family. [...] It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics. However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who eventually seem to have referred to themselves as \\'Arya\\'—was certainly two-way. That is, it involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early presence.\";\\n(e) Robb 2011, pp. 46–, \"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE.

This is not merely a reflection of the growth in the overall population, but, rather, of the fact that this dangerous trend has worsened with time.

In this manner, Central Asian cooking merged with older traditions within the subcontinent, to create such signature dishes as biryani (a fusion of the Persian pilau and the spice-laden dishes of Hindustan), and the Kashmiri meat stew of Rogan Josh. It not only generated new dishes and entire cuisines, but also fostered novel modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments, which relied heavily on almonds, pastries and quince jams, alongside Indian achars made from sweet limes, green vegetables and curds as side relishes during Mughlai meals.\\n Panjabi, Camellia (1995), The Great Curries of India, Simon and Schuster, pp. 158–, ISBN 978-0-684-80383-8, The Muslim influenced breads of India are leavened, like naan, Khamiri roti, ...\\n Davidson, Alan (2014), The Oxford Companion to Food, Oxford University Press, p. 410, ISBN 978-0-19-967733-7\\n Sahakian, Marlyne; Saloma, Czarina; Erkman, Suren (2016), Food Consumption in the City: Practices and patterns in urban Asia and the Pacific, Taylor & Francis, p. 50, ISBN 978-1-317-31050-1\\n OECD; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2018), OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018–2027, OECD Publishing, p. 21, ISBN 978-92-64-06203-0\\n Roger 2000.\\n Sengupta, Jayanta (2014), \"India\", in Freedman, Paul; Chaplin, Joyce E.; Albala, Ken (eds.), Food in Time and Place: The American Historical Association Companion to Food History, University of California Press, p. 74, ISBN 978-0-520-27745-8\\n Collingham, Elizabeth M.

For the pre-establishment era of the state, see History of India.\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, often regarded as the architect of modern India, addressing a newly independent India on 15 August 1947\\nThe history of independent India or history of Republic of India began when the country became an independent sovereign state within the British Commonwealth on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, affected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries—India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims.[1] Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the Partition of India. The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The constitution adopted in 1950 made India a democratic republic with Westminster style parliamentary system of government, both at federal and state level respectively. The democracy has been sustained since then. India\\'s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world\\'s newly independent states.[2]\\n\\nThe country has faced religious violence, naxalism, terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China which escalated into a war in 1962 and 1967, and with Pakistan which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. India was neutral in the Cold War, and was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. However, it made a loose alliance with the Soviet Union from 1971, when Pakistan was allied with the United States and the People\\'s Republic of China.\\n\\nPart of a series on the\\nHistory of India\\n\\nTimeline\\nPrehistoric\\nAncient\\nClassical\\nEarly medieval\\nLate medieval\\nEarly modern\\nModern\\nRelated articles\\nvte\\nPart of a series on the\\nHistory of South Asia\\nSouth Asia (orthographic projection)\\nOutline\\nNational histories\\nRegional histories\\nSpecialised histories\\nvte\\nIndia is a nuclear-weapon state, having conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, followed by another five tests in 1998. From the 1950s to the 1980s, India followed socialist-inspired policies. The economy was influenced by extensive regulation, protectionism and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow economic growth. Since 1991, India has pursued more economic liberalisation. Today, India is the third largest and one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\\n\\nFrom being a relatively struggling country in its formative years,[3] the Republic of India has emerged as a fast growing G20 major economy.[4][5] India has sometimes been referred to as a great power and a potential superpower given its large and growing economy, military and population.[6][7][8][9]\\n\\n1947–1950: Dominion of India\\nMain article: Dominion of India\\nIndependent India\\'s first years were marked with turbulent events—a massive exchange of population with Pakistan, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the integration of over 500 princely states to form a united nation.[10] Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi also ensured that the constitution of independent India would be secular.[11]\\n\\nPartition of India\\nMain article: Partition of India\\nThe partition of India was outlined in the Indian Independence Act 1947. It led to the dissolution of the British Raj in South Asia and the creation of two independent dominions: India and Pakistan.[12][13] The change of political borders notably included the division of two provinces of British India,[a] Bengal and Punjab.[14] The majority Muslim districts in these provinces were awarded to Pakistan and the majority non-Muslim to India. The other assets that were divided included the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Royal Indian Air Force, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury. Self-governing independent Pakistan and India legally came into existence at midnight on 14 and 15 August 1947 respectively.\\n\\n\\nThe first Cabinet of independent India[b]\\nThe partition caused large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration between the two dominions.[15] Among refugees who survived, it solidified the belief that safety lay among co-religionists. In the instance of Pakistan, it made palpable a hitherto only-imagined refuge for the Muslims of British India.[16] The migrations took place hastily and with little warning. It is thought that between 14 million and 18 million people moved, and perhaps more. Excess mortality during the period of the partition is usually estimated to have been around one million.[17] The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that affects their relationship to this day.\\n\\nAn estimated 3.5 million[18] Hindus and Sikhs living in West Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, East Bengal and Sind migrated to India in fear of domination and suppression in Muslim Pakistan. Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their Punjab and Bengal boundaries, and the cities of Calcutta, Delhi and Lahore. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of Mohandas Gandhi, the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a fast-unto-death in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the Indian Army was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\\n\\nI find no parallel in history for a body of converts and their descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock.\\n\\n—\\u200aMahatma Gandhi, opposing the division of India on the basis of religion in 1945.[19]\\nThe assassination of Mohandas Gandhi on 30 January 1948 was carried out by Nathuram Godse, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\\n\\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan, owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\\n\\nPolitical integration of India\\n\\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel as Minister for Home and States Affairs had the responsibility of welding the British Indian provinces and the princely states into a united India.\\n\\nGeneral El Edroos (at right) offers his surrender of the Hyderabad State Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri at Secunderabad.\\n\\nQueen Kanchan Prabha Devi of the Kingdom of Tripura signed the instrument of accession to India. She played a pivotal role in rehabilitating refugees and victims of the violence associated with the Partition of India in the state of Tripura.\\n\\nSheikh Mohammed Abdullah (right), chosen to head the emergency interim government in Kashmir after Maharaja Hari Singh signed Kashmir\\'s Instrument of Accession to India.\\nIntegration of princely states\\nMain article: Political integration of India\\nIn July 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India.[20] In January 1947, Nehru said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings.[21] In May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state.[22] British India consisted of 17 provinces, which existed alongside 565 princely states. The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in two particular cases—Punjab and Bengal—after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or accede to either dominion. Thus India\\'s leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented country with independent states and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made Rajpramukh (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as Saurashra, PEPSU, Vindhya Pradesh and Madhya Bharat. Some princely states such as Tripura and Manipur acceded later in 1949.\\n\\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\\n\\nJunagadh (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab)—a December 1947 plebiscite resulted in a 99% vote[23] to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the Nawab against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly Hindu and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.\\nHyderabad (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)—Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the Nizam, code-named Operation Polo, after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13 and 29 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir (a Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the First Indo-Pakistani War which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. Jawaharlal Nehru initially agreed to Mountbatten\\'s proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 January 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state.\\nConstitution\\nMain article: Constitution of India\\nThe Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950.[24] The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country\\'s fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395.[25] The constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular,[26] and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity.[27] Key features of the constitution were Universal suffrage for all adults,Westminster style parliamentary system of government at the federal and state level, and independent judiciary.[28] The constitution also required the Union Government and the States and Territories of India to set reserved quotas or seats, at particular percentage in Education Admissions, Employments, Political Bodies, Promotions, etc., for \"socially and educationally backward citizens.\"[29][30] The constitution has had more than 100 amendments since it was enacted.[31]\\n\\nIndia celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.[32]\\n\\n\\nIndian soldiers during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\\nIndo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948\\nMain article: Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948\\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 was fought between India and Pakistan over the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948. It was the first of four Indo-Pakistan Wars fought between the two newly independent nations. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal lashkar (militia) from Waziristan,[33] in an effort to secure Kashmir, the future of which hung in the balance. A United Nations-mediated ceasefire took place on 5 January 1949.\\n\\nIndian losses in the war totalled 1,104 killed and 3,154 wounded;[34] Pakistani, about 6,000 killed and 14,000 wounded.[35] Neutral assessments state India emerged victorious as it successfully defended the majority of the contested territory.[36][37][38][39][40]\\n\\nGovernance and politics\\nIndia held its first national elections under the Constitution in 1952, where a turnout of over 60% was recorded. The Indian National Congress won an overwhelming majority, and Jawaharlal Nehru began a second term as prime minister. President Prasad was also elected to a second term by the electoral college of the first Parliament of India.[41]\\n\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. He oversaw India\\'s transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, multi-party system. In foreign policy, he took a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement while projecting India as a regional hegemon in South Asia.\\nNehru administration (1952–1964)\\nNehru can be regarded as the founder of the modern Indian state. Parekh attributes this to the national philosophy Nehru formulated for India. For him, modernisation was the national philosophy, with seven goals: national unity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, socialism, development of the scientific temper, and non-alignment. In Parekh\\'s opinion, the philosophy and the policies that resulted from this benefited a large section of society such as public sector workers, industrial houses, and middle and upper peasantry. However, it failed to benefit or satisfy the urban and rural poor, the unemployed and the Hindu fundamentalists.[42]\\n\\nThe death of Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950 left Nehru as the sole remaining iconic national leader, and soon the situation became such that Nehru could implement his vision for India without hindrance.[43]\\n\\nNehru implemented economic policies based on import substitution industrialisation and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector would co-exist with the private sector.[44] He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public sector industries—steel, iron, coal, and power—promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies.[45]\\n\\nNehru led the Congress to further election victories in 1957 and 1962. During his tenure, the Indian Parliament passed extensive reforms that increased the legal rights of women in Hindu society,[46][47][48][49] and further legislated against caste discrimination and untouchability.[citation needed] Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India\\'s children to complete primary education, and thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, were founded across the nation.[50] Nehru advocated a socialist model for the economy of India. After India achieved independence, a formal model of planning was adopted, and accordingly the Planning Commission, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, was established in 1950, with Nehru as the chairman. The commission was tasked with formulating Five-Year Plans for economic development which were shaped by the Soviet model based on centralised and integrated national economic programs[51]—no taxation for Indian farmers, minimum wage and benefits for blue-collar workers, and the nationalisation of heavy industries such as steel, aviation, shipping, electricity, and mining. Village common lands were seized, and an extensive public works and industrialisation campaign resulted in the construction of major dams, irrigation canals, roads, thermal and hydroelectric power stations, and many more.[citation needed]\\n\\n\\nSouth Indian states prior to the States Reorganisation Act\\nStates reorganisation\\nMain article: States Reorganisation Act, 1956\\nPotti Sreeramulu\\'s fast-unto-death, and consequent death for the demand of an Andhra State in 1952 sparked a major re-shaping of the Indian Union. Nehru appointed the States Re-organisation Commission, upon whose recommendations the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956. Old states were dissolved and new states created on the lines of shared linguistic and ethnic demographics. The separation of Kerala and the Telugu-speaking regions of Madras State enabled the creation of an exclusively Tamil-speaking state of Tamil Nadu. On 1 May 1960, the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were created out of the bilingual Bombay State, and on 1 November 1966, the larger Punjab state was divided into the smaller, Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Haryanvi-speaking Haryana states.[52]\\n\\nDevelopment of a multi-party system\\nIn pre-independence India, the main parties were the Congress and the Muslim league. There were also many other parties such as the Hindu mahasabha, Justice party, the Akali dal, the Communist party etc. during this period with limited or regional appeal. With the eclipse of the Muslim league due to partition, the Congress party was able to dominate Indian politics during the 1950s. This started breaking down during the 60s and 70s.This period saw formation of many new parties. These included those founded by former congress leaders such as the Swatantra party, many Socialist leaning parties, and the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the political arm of the Hindu nationalist RSS.[53]\\n\\nSwatantra Party\\nMain articles: C. Rajagopalachari and Swatantra Party\\nOn 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, C. Rajagopalachari,[54] along with Murari Vaidya of the newly established Forum of Free Enterprise (FFE)[55] and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist leaning Nehru, announced the formation of the new Swatantra Party at a meeting in Madras.[56] Conceived by disgruntled heads of former princely states such as the Raja of Ramgarh, the Maharaja of Kalahandi and the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, the party was conservative in character.[57][58] Later, N. G. Ranga, K. M. Munshi, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa and the Maharaja of Patiala joined the effort.[58] Rajagopalachari, Masani and Ranga also tried but failed to involve Jayaprakash Narayan in the initiative.[59]\\n\\n\\nGayatri Devi, the Maharani of Jaipur and princess of Cooch Behar, was a successful politician in the Swatantra Party.\\nIn his short essay \"Our Democracy\", Rajagopalachari argued the necessity of a right-wing alternative to the Congress: \"since ... the Congress Party has swung to the Left, what is wanted is not an ultra or outer-Left [viz. the CPI or the Praja Socialist Party, PSP], but a strong and articulate Right.\"[57] Rajagopalachari also said the opposition must: \"operate not privately and behind the closed doors of the party meeting, but openly and periodically through the electorate.\"[57] He outlined the goals of the Swatantra Party through twenty-one \"fundamental principles\" in the foundation document.[60] The party stood for equality and opposed government control over the private sector.[61][62] Rajagopalachari sharply criticised the bureaucracy and coined the term \"licence-permit Raj\" to describe Nehru\\'s elaborate system of permissions and licences required for an individual to set up a private enterprise. Rajagopalachari\\'s personality became a rallying point for the party.[57]\\n\\nRajagopalachari\\'s efforts to build an anti-Congress front led to a patch-up with his former adversary C. N. Annadurai of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.[63] During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an alliance with the Swatantra Party for the 1962 Madras Legislative Assembly elections. Although there were occasional electoral pacts between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded.[64] The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six[65] as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections.[66]\\n\\nForeign policy and military conflicts\\nSee also: India and the Non-Aligned Movement, List of conflicts in Asia § Republic of India, and Indo-Pakistani War of 1965\\nNehru\\'s foreign policy was the inspiration of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which India was a co-founder. Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People\\'s Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18–4 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet,[67] and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute.[68]\\n\\nIndia has fought a total of four wars/military conflicts with its neighbouring rival state Pakistan, two in this period. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, Pakistan captured one-third of Kashmir (which India claims as its territory), and India captured three-fifths (which Pakistan claims as its territory). In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India attacked Pakistan on all fronts by crossing the international border after attempts by Pakistani troops to infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir by crossing the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.\\n\\nIn 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of India.[69]\\n\\nIn 1962 China and India engaged in the brief Sino-Indian War over the border in the Himalayas. The war was a complete rout for the Indians and led to a refocusing on arms build-up and an improvement in relations with the United States. China withdrew from disputed territory in the contested Chinese South Tibet and Indian North-East Frontier Agency that it crossed during the war. India disputes China\\'s sovereignty over the smaller Aksai Chin territory that it controls on the western part of the Sino-Indian border.[70]\\n\\nIndian Army officers of the 4th Sikh Regiment captured a Police Station in Lahore, Pakistan, after winning the Battle of Burki, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.\\nIndian Army officers of the 4th Sikh Regiment captured a Police Station in Lahore, Pakistan, after winning the Battle of Burki, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.\\nThe Indian Air Force used 20 small and lightweight Canberra bombers against the Portuguese forces during Operation Vijay, which led to the Annexation of Goa.\\nThe Indian Air Force used 20 small and lightweight Canberra bombers against the Portuguese forces during Operation Vijay, which led to the Annexation of Goa.\\nDisputed areas in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border including Aksai Chin, 1988 CIA map\\nDisputed areas in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border including Aksai Chin, 1988 CIA map\\n1960s after Nehru\\n\\nNehru\\'s daughter Indira Gandhi served as prime minister for three consecutive terms (1966–77) and a fourth term (1980–84).\\nJawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964, and Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded him as prime minister. In 1965, India and Pakistan again went to war over Kashmir, but without any definitive outcome or alteration of the Kashmir boundary. The Tashkent Agreement was signed under the mediation of the Soviet government, but Shastri died on the night after the signing ceremony. A leadership election resulted in the elevation of Indira Gandhi, Nehru\\'s daughter who had been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as the third prime minister. She defeated right-wing leader Morarji Desai. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation, and food crisis. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a devaluation of the rupee, which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.[71]\\n\\nIn 1967, India and China again engaged with each other in Sino-Indian War of 1967 after the PLA soldiers opened fire on the Indian soldiers who were making a fence on the border in Nathu La. The Indian forces successfully repelled Chinese forces and the outcome saw Chinese defeat with their withdrawal from Sikkim.\\n\\nMorarji Desai entered Gandhi\\'s government as deputy prime minister and finance minister, and with senior Congress politicians attempted to constrain Gandhi\\'s authority. But following the counsel of her political advisor P. N. Haksar, Gandhi resuscitated her popular appeal by a major shift towards socialist policies. She successfully ended the Privy Purse guarantee for former Indian royalty, and waged a major offensive against party hierarchy over the nationalisation of India\\'s banks. Although resisted by Desai and India\\'s business community, the policy was popular with the masses. When Congress politicians attempted to oust Gandhi by suspending her Congress membership, Gandhi was empowered with a large exodus of members of parliament to her own Congress (R). The bastion of the Indian freedom struggle, the Indian National Congress, had split in 1969. Gandhi continued to govern with a slim majority.[72]\\n\\n1970s\\n\\nIndian aircraft carrier INS Vikrant launches an Alize aircraft during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.\\nIn 1971, Indira Gandhi and her Congress (R) were returned to power with a massively increased majority. The nationalisation of banks was carried out, and many other socialist economic and industrial policies enacted. India intervened in the Bangladesh War of Independence, a civil war taking place in Pakistan\\'s Bengali half, after millions of refugees had fled the persecution of the Pakistani army. The clash resulted in the independence of East Pakistan, which became known as Bangladesh, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\\'s elevation to immense popularity. Relations with the United States grew strained, and India signed a 20-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union—breaking explicitly for the first time from non-alignment. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear weapon in the desert of Rajasthan, near Pokhran.\\n\\n\\nRumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union.\\nMerger of Sikkim\\nIn 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in the Kingdom of Sikkim. In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal\\'s palace guards. Thereafter, a referendum was held in which 97.5 percent of voters supported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India.\\n\\nIndia is said to have stationed 20,000–40,000 troops in a country of only 200,000 during the referendum.[73] On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished.[74] To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an \"associate state\", a special designation not used by any other state. A month later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.[75]\\n\\nFormation of Northeastern states\\nIn the Northeast India, the state of Assam was divided into several states beginning in 1970 within the borders of what was then Assam. In 1963, the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of Nagaland. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. In 1970, in response to the demands of the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo people of the Meghalaya Plateau, the districts embracing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state within Assam; in 1972 this became a separate state under the name of Meghalaya. In 1972, Arunachal Pradesh (the North-East Frontier Agency) and Mizoram (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam as union territories; both became states in 1986.[76]\\n\\nAssam till the 1950s: The new states of Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram formed in the 1960-70s.

The government sponsored modern agricultural implements, new varieties of generic seeds, and increased financial assistance to farmers that increased the yield of food crops such as wheat, rice and corn, as well as commercial crops like cotton, tea, tobacco and coffee.[78] Increased agricultural productivity expanded across the states of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Punjab.\\n\\nUnder Operation Flood, the government encouraged the production of milk, which increased greatly, and improved rearing of livestock across India.

The war was fought in December 1971 over the issue of Bangladesh. India decisively defeated Pakistan, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh.\\n\\nThe crisis started with Punjabi dominated Pakistani army refusing to surrender power to the newly elected but mainly Bengali Awami League led by Shaikh Mujibur Rehman. Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence in march of 1971 by Rehman led to widespread atrocities being committed by the Pakistani army against select groups. It is estimated that starting in March 1971, members of the Pakistani military and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias killed between 300,000 and 3,000,000 civilians in Bangladesh.[80][81][82][83][84] During the conflict, members of the Pakistani military and supporting pro-Pakistani Islamist militias called the Razakars raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape.[85][86][87][88] The murders and rapes led to an estimated eight to ten million people to flee East Pakistan to seek refuge in India.[89][90][91][92][93]\\n\\nOfficial de-jure war began with Pakistan airforce-affiliated Operation Chengiz Khan, which consisted of preemptive aerial strikes on 11 Indian air stations resulting in minor damages and suspension of counter-air operations for mere few hours.[94] The strikes led to India declaring war on Pakistan, marking their entry into the war for East Pakistan\\'s independence, on the side of Bengali nationalist forces. India\\'s entry expanded the existing conflict with Indian and Pakistani forces engaging on both the eastern and western fronts.[95] Thirteen days into the war, India had achieved total superiority into the East meanwhile it had sufficient superiority in the West, which resulted later in Eastern defence of Pakistan to sign a joint instrument of surrender.[96][97] on 16 December 1971 in Dhaka, ending conflict officially and marking the formation of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh. Approximately 93,000 Pakistani servicemen were taken prisoner by the Indian Army, which included 79,676 to 81,000 uniformed personnel of the Pakistan Armed Forces, including some Bengali soldiers who had remained loyal to Pakistan.[98][99] The remaining 10,324 to 12,500 prisoners were civilians, either family members of the military personnel or collaborators (Razakars).[100][101][102]\\n\\nJayaprakash Narayan on a 2001 stamp of India.

The economic and social problems caused by high inflation, as well as allegations of corruption against Indira Gandhi and her government, caused increasing political unrest across India during 1973–74. This included the Railway Strike in 1974, the Maoist Naxalite movement, the Bihar student agitations, the United Women\\'s Anti- Price Rise Front in Maharashtra and the Nav Nirman movement in Gujarat.[103][104]\\n\\nRaj Narain was the Samyukta Socialist Party Candidate and Indira\\'s opponent in the 1971 Lok Sabha elections from Rai Bareli. Although he suffered a defeat from her in 1971 elections, he accused Indira Gandhi of corrupt electoral practices and filed an election petition against her. Four years later on 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court gave their verdict, and found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes.[105] Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under Jaya Prakash Narayan to resist what he termed Gandhi\\'s dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi.\\n\\nDeclaration of the emergency\\nOn 25 June 1975, Gandhi advised President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a state of emergency under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many civil liberties and postponed elections at national and state levels.[106][107] Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned.[108] Her government also introduced a contentious programme of compulsory birth control.[109][110][111][112][113][114] Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\\n\\nLife during the emergency\\nIndia\\'s economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and authoritarian conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira\\'s then twentynine year old son, and unofficial political advisor, Sanjay Gandhi, was accused of committing gross excesses—Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced vasectomies of men and sterilisation of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in Delhi near the Turkmen Gate, which left hundreds of people dead or injured, and many more displaced.[110][111][112][113][114][115][116]\\n\\n\\nMorarji Desai, the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India, signing the \"New Delhi\" declaration during a visit by US President Jimmy Carter.\\nJanata interlude\\nMain article: Janata Party\\nIndira Gandhi\\'s Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the Janata Party, an amalgamation of opposition parties.[117] Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India.

Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and prime minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country\\'s long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother\\'s assassination.[120]\\n\\nRajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the Licence Raj was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India\\'s national reserves. As prime minister, Rajiv broke from his mother\\'s precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation. Rajiv\\'s encouragement of science and technology resulted in a major expansion of the telecommunications industry and India\\'s space programme, and gave birth to the software industry and information technology sector.[121]\\n\\nIn December 1984, gas leaked out at the Union Carbide pesticides plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal.

Rajiv sent Indian troops to enforce the agreement and disarm the Tamil rebels, but the Indian Peace Keeping Force, as it was known, became entangled in outbreaks of violence, ultimately ending up fighting the Tamil rebels itself, and becoming a target of attack from Sri Lankan nationalists.[122] V. P. Singh withdrew the IPKF in 1990, but thousands of Indian soldiers had died. Rajiv\\'s departure from socialist policies did not sit well with the masses, who did not benefit from the innovations. Unemployment was a serious problem, and India\\'s burgeoning population added ever-increasing needs for diminishing resources.\\n\\nRajiv Gandhi\\'s image as an honest politician (he was nicknamed \"Mr. Clean\" by the press) was shattered when the Bofors scandal broke, revealing that senior government officials had taken bribes over defence contracts by a Swedish guns producer.[123]\\n\\nJanata Dal\\nGeneral elections in 1989 gave Rajiv\\'s Congress a plurality, much less than the majority which propelled him to power.[124]\\n\\nPower came instead to his former finance and defence minister, VP Singh of Janata Dal. Singh had been moved from the Finance ministry to the Defence ministry after he unearthed some scandals which made the Congress leadership uncomfortable. Singh then unearthed the Bofors scandal, and was sacked from the party and office.[125] Becoming a popular crusader for reform and clean government, Singh led the Janata Dal coalition to a majority. He was supported by BJP and the leftist parties from outside. Becoming Prime Minister, Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple shrine, to heal the wounds of the past. He implemented the Mandal Commission report, to increase the quota in reservation for low-caste Hindus.[126] His government fell after Singh, along with Bihar\\'s Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav\\'s government, had Advani arrested in Samastipur and stopped his Ram Rath Yatra, which was going to the Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya on 23 October 1990. The Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew their support to Singh government, causing them to lose parliamentary vote of confidence on 7 November 1990.[127] Chandra Shekhar split to form the Janata Dal (Socialist), supported by Rajiv\\'s Congress. This new government also collapsed in a matter of months, when Congress withdrew its support.\\n\\n\\nThe stone mosaic that stands at the exact location where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in Sriperumbudur.\\n1990s\\nMain articles: 1990s in India, Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, and Bombay riots\\nThe then-Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah (son of former Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah) announced an alliance with the ruling Congress party for the elections of 1987. But, the elections were allegedly rigged in favour of him. This led to the rise of the armed extremist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost elections. India has constantly maintained the position of blaming Pakistan for supplying these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training.[128]\\n\\nMilitants in Kashmir reportedly tortured and killed local Kashmiri Pandits, forcing them to leave Kashmir in large numbers.[129][better source needed] Around 90% of the Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir during the 1990s, resulting in the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus.[citation needed]\\n\\nOn 21 May 1991, while former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi campaigned in Tamil Nadu on behalf of Congress (Indira), a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) female suicide bomber assassinated him and many others by setting off the bomb in her belt by leaning forward while garlanding him. In the elections, Congress (Indira) won 244 parliamentary seats and put together a coalition, returning to power under the leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao. This Congress-led government, which served a full five-year term, initiated a gradual process of economic liberalisation and reform, which has opened the Indian economy to global trade and investment. India\\'s domestic politics also took new shape, as traditional alignments by caste, creed, and ethnicity gave way to a plethora of small, regionally-based political parties.[130]\\n\\nBut India was rocked by communal violence (see Bombay riots) between Hindus and Muslims that killed over 10,000 people, following the Babri Mosque demolition by Hindu extremists in the course of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya in December 1992.[131] The final months of the Rao-led government in the spring of 1996 suffered the effects of several major political corruption scandals, which contributed to the worst electoral performance by the Congress Party in its history till then as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the largest single party.[132]\\n\\nP.

V. Narasimha Rao and his then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, India\\'s economy expanded rapidly. The economic reforms were a reaction to an impending balance of payment crisis. The Rao administration initiated the privatisation of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the 1997 Asian financial crisis and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound fiscal policy aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Ahmedabad have risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment and firms. Strategies like forming Special Economic Zones—tax amenities, good communications infrastructure, low regulation—to encourage industries has paid off in many parts of the country.[136]\\n\\nA rising generation of well-educated and skilled professionals in scientific sectors of the industry began propelling the Indian economy, as the information technology industry took hold across India with the proliferation of computers. The new technologies increased the efficiency of activity in almost every type of industry, which also benefitted from the availability of skilled labor. Foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs to India\\'s labor markets further enhanced India\\'s economic growth. A large middle class has arisen across India, which has increased the demand, and thus the production of a wide array of consumer goods. Unemployment is steadily declining, and poverty has fallen to approximately 22%. Gross Domestic Product growth increased to beyond 7%. While serious challenges remain, India is enjoying a period of economic expansion that has propelled it to the forefront of the world economy, and has correspondingly increased its influence in political and diplomatic terms.[2]\\n\\n\\nNuclear capable Agni-II ballistic missile. Since May 1998, India declared itself to be a full-fledged nuclear state.\\nEra of coalitions\\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha but without enough strength to prove a majority on the floor of that Parliament. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the Janata Dal emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former Chief Minister of Karnataka H. D. Deve Gowda lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew support in March 1997. Inder Kumar Gujral replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition.[137]\\n\\nIn November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with Vajpayee again serving as prime minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of five underground nuclear weapons tests, known collectively as Pokhran-II — which caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year.[138] India\\'s nuclear tests prompted President of the United States Bill Clinton and Japan to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act and led to widespread international condemnation.\\n\\nIn the early months of 1999, Prime Minister Vajpayee made a historic bus trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistan\\'s prime minister Nawaz Sharif, signing the bilateral Lahore peace declaration.[109]\\n\\nIn April 1999, the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell apart, leading to fresh elections in September. In May and June 1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign of terrorist infiltration that resulted in the Kargil War in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace process that had begun only three months earlier when Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore bus service. Indian forces killed Pakistan-backed infiltrators and reclaimed important border posts in high-altitude warfare.[139]\\n\\nSoaring on popularity earned following the successful conclusion of the Kargil conflict, the National Democratic Alliance—a new coalition led by the BJP—gained a majority to form a government with Vajpayee as prime minister in October 1999. The end of the millennium was devastating to India, as a cyclone hit Orissa, killing at least 10,000.[109]\\n\\n\\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee became the first non-Congress Prime Minister to complete a full term.

The move was seen as a reward for their support for the War on Terror. The tensions of an imminent war between India and Pakistan again rose by the heavy Indian firing on Pakistani military posts along the Line of Control and the subsequent deadly Indian Parliament attack and the 2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff.[109]\\n\\nIn 2002, 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed in a train fire in Godhra, Gujarat.

Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister, after the Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, declined to take the office, to defuse the controversy about whether her foreign birth should be considered a disqualification for the Prime Minister\\'s post. Apart from the Congress party, other members of UPA included Socialist and regional parties. The alliance had outside support of India\\'s Communist parties. Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh and non-Hindu to hold India\\'s most powerful office. Singh continued economic liberalisation, although the need for support from Indian Socialists and Communists forestalled further privatisation for some time.[142][143]\\n\\nBy the end of 2004, India began to withdraw some of its troops from Kashmir. By the middle of the next year, the Srinagar–Muzaffarabad Bus service was inaugurated, the first in 60 years to operate between Indian-administered and Pakistani-administered Kashmirs. However, in May 2006, suspected Islamic extremist militants killed 35 Hindus in the worst attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir for several months.[109]\\n\\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami devastated Indian coastlines and islands, killing an estimated 18,000 and displacing around 650,000.

Later, United States approved a controversial law allowing India to buy their nuclear reactors and fuel for the first time in 30 years. In July 2008, the United Progressive Alliance survived a vote of confidence brought after left-wing parties withdrew their support over the nuclear deal. After the vote, several left-wing and regional parties formed a new alliance to oppose the government, saying it had been tainted by corruption. Within three months, following approval by the U.S. Congress, George W.

In April 2013, the Saradha Group scandal was unearthed, caused by the collapse of a Ponzi scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies in Eastern India, causing an estimated loss of INR 200–300 billion (US$4–6 billion) to over 1.7 million depositors.[159][160][161] In December 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the Delhi High Court ruling on Sec 377, criminalising homosexual sex between consenting adults once again in the country.[162][163]\\n\\nIn August – September 2013, clashes between Hindus and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, resulted in at least 62 deaths,[164] injured 93, and left more than 50,000 displaced.[165][166][167][168]\\n\\n\\nArtist\\'s rendering of the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft\\nIn November 2013, India launched its first interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission, popularly known as Mangalyaan, to Mars and, was successful, so ISRO on 24 September 2014, became the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency.[169] ISRO also became the first space agency and India the first country to reach Mars on its maiden attempt.\\n\\n2014 – Return of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government\\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right since the 1950s had been the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. The Jana Sangh joined the Janata party in 1977 but when that party fell apart in a short period of three years, the erstwhile members of Jana Sangh in 1980 formed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP grew its support base in the following decades and is now the most dominant political party in India. In September 2013 the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, was named the BJP\\'s candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[170][171] Several BJP leaders initially expressed opposition to Modi\\'s candidature,[172] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani.[173] Contrary to the strategies used by the party during previous elections, Modi played the dominant role in the BJP\\'s presidential style election campaign.[174][175][170][176][177][172][178][179] The 16th national general election, held in early 2014, saw a huge victory for the BJP led NDA; the alliance gained an absolute majority and formed a government under the premiership of Modi. The Modi government\\'s sweeping mandate and popularity helped the BJP win several state assembly elections in India. The Modi government implemented several initiatives and campaigns to increase manufacturing and infrastructure – notably — Make in India, Digital India and the Swachh Bharat Mission.\\n\\nThe largest tax reform in India\\'s history, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), was introduced in 2017. A vehicle-borne suicide bomber assaulted a convoy of cars carrying Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troops on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway in the Pulwama area of Jammu and Kashmir.[180]\\n\\nIndia carried out the 2019 Balakot airstrike when its airplanes flew across the de facto border in Kashmir and dropped bombs in the town of Balakot in Pakistan\\'s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region.[181] After a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani fighter pilots. Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian wing commander, was taken prisoner by the Pakistani side. Acting nonetheless under pressure from various world leaders and constrained by the Vienna Convention, Pakistan was compelled to free the Indian pilot.[182]\\n\\nBy repealing Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was separated into two separate union territories known as Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.[183] The BJP government introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act in 2019, sparking widespread protests.[184]\\n\\nPrime Minister Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme which was meant to encourage companies to manufacture their products in India and also increase their investment.\\nPrime Minister Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme which was meant to encourage companies to manufacture their products in India and also increase their investment.\\n \\n10th President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Gadi Eizenkot with PM Modi, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel.\\n10th President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Gadi Eizenkot with PM Modi, the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel.\\n \\nGeosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III is intended as a launch vehicle for crewed missions under the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme announced in Prime Minister Modi\\'s 2018 Independence Day speech.[185]\\nGeosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III is intended as a launch vehicle for crewed missions under the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme announced in Prime Minister Modi\\'s 2018 Independence Day speech.[185]\\n2020s\\nIn February 2020, riots broke out in Delhi.[186] The Citizenship Amendment Act protests have been described as an instigating factor.[187] Tensions escalated on the Indo-China border after aggressive skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops beginning on 5 May 2020.[188] The Rama Janmabhoomi temple construction officially started after a Bhoomi Poojan (Hindu ground breaking) ceremony by Prime Minister Modi on 5 August 2020.[189][190] Farm reform laws which subsequently became quite controversial were passed with less than three hours of debate in either house in September 2020.[191]\\n\\nAfter a year long protests by farmers, Prime minister Modi in November 2021 repealed the laws in three minutes in the Lok Sabha and nine minutes in the Rajya Sabha without debate.[192]\\n\\n\\nCOVID-19 vaccination queue in Nagpur, 1 May 2021\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic in India\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in India began on 30 January 2020, when the first case was reported in Thrissur.[193] Two months later in March 2020, prime minister Modi imposed a complete lockdown in the country at four hours notice to stop the spread of COVID-19. This led to millions losing their jobs and many lost their lives. The Indian economy also shrunk in percentage terms by double digit numbers. In September 2020, India\\'s health minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the country planned to approve and begin distribution of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021.[194] Vaccination against COVID-19 started in India on 16 January 2021. By early April 2021, second wave of infections took hold in the country with destructive consequences.[195] According to Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York, technocratic competence had been entirely missing from government\\'s response to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India.[196] The second wave placed a major strain on the healthcare system,[197] including shortage of liquid medical oxygen. The number of new cases had begun to steadily drop by late-May and vaccination gained momentum again. India administered 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine on 21 October 2021.[198] Although official number of Covid related deaths in India during the pandemic is less than half a million, excess mortality rates for all causes has been estimated at between 3 and 5 million deaths.[199]\\n\\n\\nCurrent Vice President (left), President (middle) and Prime Minister of India\\nPost COVID India\\nOn 25 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu was sworn in as India\\'s new president, becoming India\\'s first tribal president. Although largely ceremonial post, Murmu\\'s election as tribal woman was historic.[200] India celebrated 75 years of its independence from the British Empire on 15 August 2022.[201] In April 2023, India surpassed China to become the most populous country on the earth with a population of over 1.425 billion.[202] India was selected as the host for the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit at the International Exhibition Convention Centre, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi from 9 to 10 September 2023.[203] Chandrayaan-3, a lunar lander developed and launched by ISRO landed on the Moon on 23 August 2023, thus making India the 4th country to land on the Moon after the Soviet Union, China, and United States.[204]\\n\\nGeneral elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases to elect the members of 18th Lok Sabha. The BJP won 240 seats, down from 303 seats it had secured in 2019, and lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha. Modi confirmed the support of 293 NDA MPs to President Draupadi Murmu, which marked Modi\\'s third term as prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government, with the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging as two main allies.[205]\\n\\nEconomy\\nThe economic history of the India since 1947 can be divided into two epochs: 1.1947-91 which saw heavy government involvement in the economy, and a slow growth rate in GDP 2.1991–present which saw deregulation and a rapid growth in GDP, and reduction in poverty.\\n\\nPre-liberalisation period (1947–1991)\\nMain article: Licence Raj\\nIndian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial experience, which was seen as exploitative by Indian leaders exposed to British social democracy and the planned economy of the Soviet Union.[206] Domestic policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public sector, business regulation, and central planning,[207] while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal.[208] Five-Year Plans of India resembled central planning in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools, telecommunications, insurance, and power plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s.[209] The Indian economy of this period is characterised as Dirigism.[99][210]\\n\\n\\nChange in per capita GDP of India, 1820–2015. Figures are inflation-adjusted to 1990 International Geary-Khamis dollars.[211][212]\\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, along with the statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, formulated and oversaw economic policy during the initial years of the country\\'s independence. They expected favourable outcomes from their strategy, involving the rapid development of heavy industry by both public and private sectors, and based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme Soviet-style central command system.[213][214][215] The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive heavy industry and subsidising manual, low-skill cottage industries was criticised by economist Milton Friedman, who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers.[216]\\n\\nSince 1965, the use of high-yielding varieties of seeds, increased fertilisers and improved irrigation facilities collectively contributed to the Green Revolution in India, which improved the condition of agriculture by increasing crop productivity, improving crop patterns and strengthening forward and backward linkages between agriculture and industry.[217] However, it has also been criticised as an unsustainable effort, resulting in the growth of capitalistic farming, ignoring institutional reforms and widening income disparities.[218]\\n\\nIn 1984, Rajiv Gandhi promised economic liberalization, he made V. P. Singh the finance minister, who tried to reduce tax evasion and tax receipts rose due to this crackdown although taxes were lowered. This process lost its momentum during the later tenure of Mr. Gandhi as his government was marred by scandals.\\n\\nPost-liberalisation period (since 1991)\\nMain articles: Economic liberalisation in India and Economic development in India\\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union, which was India\\'s major trading partner, and the Gulf War, which caused a spike in oil prices, resulted in a major balance-of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of defaulting on its loans.[219] India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which in return demanded de-regulation.[220]\\n\\nIn response, the Narasimha Rao government, including Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, initiated economic reforms in 1991. The reforms did away with the Licence Raj, reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many sectors.[221] Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained unchanged since 1991, although no government had tried taking on powerful lobbies such as trade unions and farmers and on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies.[222] By the turn of the 21st century, India had progressed towards a free-market economy, with a substantial reduction in state control of the economy and increased financial liberalisation.[223] This has been accompanied by increases in life expectancy, literacy rates, and food security, although urban residents have benefited more than rural residents.[224]\\n\\n\\nGDP grows exponentially, almost doubling every five years.\\nIn the second decade of this century, the economy of India rose from the ninth-largest to the fifth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, surpassing the UK, France, Italy and Brazil.[225] The economy had started to slow down in the second term of Manmohan Singh\\'s tenure but started a recovery in 2013–14 when the GDP growth rate accelerated to 6.4% from the previous year\\'s 5.5%. The acceleration continued through 2014–15 and 2015–16 with growth rates of 7.5% and 8.0% respectively in the early early years under Narendra Modi\\'s first term. However the growth rate subsequently decelerated, to 7.1% and 6.6% in 2016–17 and 2017–18 respectively,[226] partly because of the disruptive effects of 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (India).[227]\\n\\n\\nIndian GDP growth rate from 1985 to 2016 in red, compared to that of China in green\\nCOVID-19 pandemic and aftermath (2020–present)\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous rating agencies downgraded India\\'s GDP predictions for FY21 to negative figures,[228][229] signalling a recession in India, the most severe since 1979.[230][231] The Indian Economy contracted by 6.6 percent which was lower than the estimated 7.3 percent decline.[232] In 2022, the ratings agency Fitch Ratings upgraded India\\'s outlook to stable similar to S&P Global Ratings and Moody\\'s Investors Service\\'s outlooks.[233] In the first quarter of financial year 2022–2023, the Indian economy grew by 13.5%.[234]\\n\\nSee also\\nflag\\tIndia portal\\nDemocracy in India\\nPolitics of India\\nEconomic history of India\\nEconomy of India\\nMilitary history of India\\nOutline of ancient India\\nThe Emergency (India)\\nLicence Raj\\nNotes\\n British India consisted of those regions of the British Raj, or the British Indian Empire, which were directly administered by Britain; other regions of nominal sovereignty that were indirectly ruled by Britain were called princely states.\\n The first Cabinet of independent India (L to R sitting) B.

The departing British also decreed that the hundreds of princes, who ruled one-third of the subcontinent and a quarter of its population, became legally independent, their status to be settled later. Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its exclusive sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and judiciary split roughly along religious \\'communal\\' lines, even as they divided movable government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3 percent for India.\\n Khan, Yasmin (2017) [2007], The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan (2 ed.), New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 1, ISBN 978-0-300-23032-1, South Asians learned that the British Indian empire would be partitioned on 3 June 1947. They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India\\n Talbot & Singh 2009, p. [page needed]: \"When the British divided and quit India in August 1947, they not only partitioned the subcontinent with the emergence of the two nations of India and Pakistan but also the provinces of Punjab and Bengal. ... Indeed for many the Indian subcontinent\\'s division in August 1947 is seen as a unique event which defies comparative historical and conceptual analysis\"\\n Chatterji, Joya; Washbrook, David (2013), \"Introduction: Concepts and Questions\", in Chatterji, Joya; Washbrook, David (eds.), Routledge Handbook of the South Asian Diaspora, London and New York: Routledge, ISBN 978-0-415-48010-9, Joya Chatterji describes how the partition of the British Indian empire into the new nation states of India and Pakistan produced new diaspora on a vast, and hitherto unprecedented, scale, but hints that the sheer magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also Chatterji 2013). She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of \\'overseas Indians\\'; and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries.\\n Metcalf, Barbara D.; Metcalf, Thomas R. (2012), A Concise History of Modern India, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-1-107-02649-0, The loss of life was immense, with estimates ranging from several hundred thousand up to a million. But, even for those who survived, fear generated a widespread perception that one could be safe only among the members of one\\'s own community; and this in turn helped consolidate loyalties towards the state, whether India or Pakistan, in which one might find a secure haven. This was especially important for Pakistan, where the succour it offered to Muslims gave that state for the first time a visible territorial reality. Fear too drove forward a mass migration unparalleled in the history of South Asia. Within a period of some three or four months in late 1947 a number of Hindus and Sikhs estimated at some 5 million moved from West Punjab into India, while 5.5 million Muslims travelled in the opposite direction. The outcome, akin to what today is called \\'ethnic cleansing\\', produced an Indian Punjab 60 per cent Hindu and 35 per cent Sikh, while the Pakistan Punjab became almost wholly Muslim. A similar, though less extensive, migration took place between east and west Bengal, though murderous attacks on fleeing refugees, with the attendant loss of life, were much less extensive in the eastern region. Even those who did not move, if of the wrong community, often found themselves treated as though they were the enemy. In Delhi itself, the city\\'s Muslims, cowering in an old fort, were for several months after partition regarded with intense suspicion and hostility. Overall, partition uprooted some 12.5 million of undivided India\\'s people.\\n Dyson, Tim (2018), A Population History of India: From the First Modern People to the Present Day, Oxford University Press, p. 189, ISBN 978-0-19-882905-8, The sudden refugee flows related to Partition may at the time have been unsurpassed in modern world history. It is likely that at least 14–18 million people moved. Previous assessments of the mortality associated with Partition have varied between 200,000 and 1 million. The first figure, attributed to Mountbatten (the last Viceroy) smacks of a number that—conveniently from an official perspective—minimises the loss of life. However, the figure of 1 million may also be too low. The data, however, do not allow for a firmer judgement.\\n Pakistan, Encarta. Archived 31 October 2009.\\n Prof. Prasoon (1 January 2010).

For other uses of \"Bharat\", see Bharat (disambiguation).\\n\\nThe geographic region containing the Indian subcontinent\\nThe Republic of India has two principal official short names, each of which is historically significant: India and Bharat. A third name, Hindustan, is also used when North Indians speak among themselves. The usage of \"India\", \"Bharat\", or \"Hindustan\" depends on the context and language of conversation.\\n\\nThe name \"India\" is originally derived from the name of the Indus river and has been in use in Greek since Herodotus (5th century BCE). The term appeared in Old English by the 9th century and reemerged in Modern English in the 17th century.\\n\\n\"Bhārat\" gained popularity in India during the nineteenth century. It is the shortened form of the term \"Bhāratavarṣa\" which is extensively used in the literature of the native religions. \"Bhāratavarṣa\" is derived from the name of the Vedic tribe of Bharatas who are mentioned in the Rigveda as one of the principal peoples of Aryavarta. At first the name Bhāratavarṣa referred only to the western part of the Gangetic Valley,[1][2] In 1949, it was adopted as an official name for the Republic of India by the Constituent Assembly along with \"India\".\\n\\n\"Hindustān\" is another common name for the Republic of India and is also derived from the name of the river Indus. It gained popularity in India in the 11th century in Islamic literature and became the common name for the northern Indian subcontinent in Indian languages, though it has been in Persian usage since at least the 3rd century CE while its earlier form \"Hindush\" was used as early as 6th century BCE. The term \\'Hindu\\' was the Old Persian adaption of \"Sindhu\" (another name for the river Indus). \"Hindustan\" is still commonly used in the subcontinent to refer to the modern day Republic of India by Hindustani speakers.\\n\\nIndia\\nFurther information: India (Herodotus)\\n\\nIndia was the lower Indus basin in Herodotus\\'s view of the world.\\nThe English term is from Greek Indikē (cf. Megasthenes\\' work Indica) or Indía (Ἰνδία), via Latin transliteration India.[3][4][5]\\n\\nThe name derives from Sanskrit Sindhu, which was the name of the Indus River as well as the lower Indus basin (modern Sindh, in Pakistan).[6][7]\\n\\nSouthworth suggests that the name Sindhu is in turn derived from Cintu, a Dravidian word for date palm, a tree commonly found in Sindh.[8][9]\\n\\nThe Old Persian equivalent of Síndhu was Hindu.[10] Darius I conquered Sindh in about 516 BCE, upon which the Persian equivalent Hinduš was used for the province at the lower Indus basin.[11][12] Scylax of Caryanda who explored the Indus river for the Persian emperor probably took over the Persian name and passed it into Greek.[13] The terms Indos for the Indus river as well as \"an Indian\" are found in Herodotus\\'s Geography.[14] The loss of the aspirate /h/ was probably due to the dialects of Greek spoken in Asia Minor.[15][16] Herodotus also generalised the term \"Indian\" from the people of lower Indus basin, to all the people living to the east of Persia, even though he had no knowledge of the geography of the land.[17]\\n\\nBy the time of Alexander, Indía in Koine Greek denoted the region beyond the Indus. Alexander\\'s companions were aware of at least India up to the Ganges delta (Gangaridai).[18][19] Later, Megasthenes included in India the southern peninsula as well.[19]\\n\\nLatin India is used by Lucian (2nd century CE).[citation needed] India was known in Old English language and was used in King Alfred\\'s translation of Paulus Orosius. In Middle English, the name was, under French influence, replaced by Ynde or Inde, which entered Early Modern English as \"Indie\". The name \"India\" then came back to English usage from the 17th century onward, and may be due to the influence of Latin, or Spanish or Portuguese.[citation needed]\\n\\nSanskrit indu \"drop (of Soma)\", also a term for the Moon, is unrelated, but has sometimes been erroneously connected.[citation needed]\\n\\nIndies\\nThe term \"Indies\" refers to the land east of river Indus. It is fully interchangeable with the word India. Portuguese initially described the entire region they discovered as the Indies. Caribbean islands were initially described as \"Indies\" as they were thought to be India. When they became known to be in western hemisphere, they were renamed as West Indies. Thus West Indies means India in the western hemisphere. Indonesia\\'s former name is Dutch East Indies which means India in southeast Asia (this should not to be confused with Dutch India, which referred to the trading posts of VOC within the Indian subcontinent).\\n\\nBharat\\nBharat is another name of India, as set down in Article 1 of the Constitution, adopted in 1950, which states in English: \"India, that is Bharat,...\"[20] Bharat, which was predominantly used in Sanskrit, was adopted as a self-ascribed alternative name by some people of the Indian subcontinent and the Republic of India.[21]\\n\\nBharat is derived from the name of the Vedic community Bharatas, who are mentioned in the Rigveda as one of the original community of the Āryāvarta and notably participating in the Battle of the Ten Kings.\\n\\nThe designation Bharat appears in the official Sanskrit name of the country, Bhāratagaṇarājya. The name is derived from the ancient Hindu Puranas, which refer to the land that comprises India as Bhāratavarṣa and uses this term to distinguish it from other varṣas or continents.[22] For example, the Vayu Purana says \"he who conquers the whole of Bhāratavarṣa is celebrated as a samrāṭa (Vayu Puran 45, 86).\"[23]\\n\\nThe Sanskrit word Bhārata is a vrddhi derivation of Bharata, which was originally an epithet of Agni. The term is a verbal noun of the Sanskrit root bhr-, \"to bear/to carry\", with a literal meaning of to be maintained (of fire). The root bhr is cognate with the English verb to bear and Latin ferō. This term also means \"one who is engaged in search for knowledge\". Barato, the Esperanto name for India, is also a derivation of Bhārata.\\n\\nThis realm of Bharat, which has been referred to as Bhāratavarṣa in puranas - after Bharata, the son of Rishabha. He is described to be a Kshatriya born in the Solar dynasty.[24] This has been mentioned in Vishnu Purana (2,1,31), Vayu Puran (33,52), Linga Purana (1,47,23), Brahmanda Purana (14,5,62), Agni Purana (107,11–12), Skand Purana (37,57) and Markanday Purana (50,41), all using the designation Bhāratavarṣa.\\n\\nThe Vishnu Purana mentions:\\n\\nUttaraṃ yat samudrasya himādreścaiva dakṣiṇam.\\nvarṣaṃ tad bhārataṃ nāma bhāratī yatra santatiḥ.\\nThe country that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhāratam there dwell the descendants of Bharata.\\n—Vishnu Purana (2,3,1)\\nThe Bhagavat Puran mentions (Canto 5, Chapter 4)[25] - \"He (Rishabha) begot a hundred sons that were exactly like him... He (Bharata) had the best qualities and it was because of him that this land by the people is called Bhāratavarṣa\"\\n\\nBharat Khand (or Bhārat Kṣētra[26]) is a term used in some of the Hindu texts.\\n\\nIn the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharat (200 BCE to 300 CE), a larger region of Indosphere is encompassed by the term Bharat.[27] Some other Puranic passages refer to the same Bhārata people, who are described as the descendants of Dushyanta\\'s son Bharata in the Mahabharata.[28]\\n\\nThe use of Bharat often has political overtones, appealing to a certain cultural conception of India.[29] In 2023, President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the Bharat name in connection with a G20 gathering, which caused speculation on a name-change for the country.[30][31] Such a change would need a constitutional amendment, meaning two-thirds of the vote in each of the two houses of parliament,[32] and an official notice to the UN, advising how to write the name in the UN\\'s six official languages.[33]\\n\\nEpigraphical references\\nThe earliest recorded use of Bhārata-varṣa (lit.\\u2009\\'Bharat mainland\\') in a geographical sense is in the Hathigumpha inscription of King Kharavela (first century BCE), where it applies only to a restrained area of northern India, namely the part of the Ganges west of Magadha. The inscription clearly mentions Bharat was named after Bharata, the son of first Jain tirthankar Rishabhanatha.[1][2]\\n\\nHind / Hindustan\\nMain article: Hindustan\\n\\nO4\\tN35\\tD46\\tV4\\tM17\\tM17\\nH-n-d-wꜢ-y\\n\"India\" written in Egyptian hieroglyphs on the Statue of Darius I, circa 500 BCE.\\nThe words Hindū (Persian: هندو) and Hind (Persian: هند) came from Indo-Aryan/Sanskrit Sindhu (the Indus River or its region). The Achaemenid emperor Darius I conquered the Indus valley in about 516 BCE, upon which the Achaemenid equivalent of Sindhu, viz., \"Hindush\" (𐏃𐎡𐎯𐎢𐏁, H-i-du-u-š) was used for the lower Indus basin.[11][12] The name was also known as far as the Achaemenid province of Egypt where it was written \\nO4\\tN35\\tD46\\tV4\\tM17\\tM17\\n (H-n-d-wꜣ-y) on the Statue of Darius I, circa 500 BCE.[34][35][36]\\n\\n\\nThe name \"al-Hind\" (here بالهند Bil\\'Hind, \"In India\") on an Umayyad coin minted in India, from the time of the first Governor of Sindh Muhammad ibn Qasim in 715 CE.[a]\\nIn middle Persian, probably from the first century CE, the suffix -stān (Persian: ستان) was added, indicative of a country or region, forming the name Hindūstān.[37] Thus, Sindh was referred to as Hindustān in the Naqsh-e-Rustam inscription of Sassanid emperor Shapur I in c. 262 CE.[38][39]\\n\\nEmperor Babur of the Mughal Empire said, \"On the East, the South, and the West it is bounded by the Great Ocean.\"[40] Hind was notably adapted in the Arabic language as the definitive form Al-Hind (الهند) for India, for example, in the 11th-century Tarikh Al-Hind (\\'History of India\\'). It occurs intermittently in usage within India, such as in the phrase Jai Hind (Hindi: जय हिन्द) or in Hind Mahāsāgar (हिन्द महासागर), the Standard Hindi name for the Indian Ocean.\\n\\nBoth the names were current in Persian and Arabic, and from that into northern Indian languages, from the 11th century Islamic conquests: the rulers in the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal periods called their Indian dominion, centered around Delhi, \"Hindustan\". In contemporary Persian and Hindi-Urdu, the term Hindustan has recently come to mean the Republic of India. The same is the case with Arabic, where al-Hind is the name for the Republic of India.\\n\\n\"Hindustan\", as the term Hindu itself, entered the English language in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the term as used in English referred to the Subcontinent. \"Hindustan\" was in use simultaneously with \"India\" during the British era.\\n\\nJambudvīpa\\n\\nThe name Jambudīpasi for \"India\" (Brahmi script) in the Sahasram Minor Rock Edict of Ashoka, circa 250 BCE.[41]\\nJambudvīpa (Sanskrit: जम्बुद्वीपम्, romanized: Jambu-dvīpam, lit.\\u2009\\'berry island\\') was used in ancient scriptures as a name of India before the term Bhārat became widespread. It might be an indirect reference to the Insular India.[clarification needed] The derivative Jambu Dwipa was the historical term for India in many Southeast Asian countries before the introduction of the English word \"India\". This alternate name is still used occasionally in Thailand, Malaysia, Java and Bali to describe the Indian Subcontinent. However, it also can refer to the whole continent of Asia. It was used by Maurya Emperor Ashoka in his inscriptions to denote his realm.\\n\\nGyagar and Phagyul\\n\\nBoth Gyagar (\"White expanse\", analogous to the names Gyanak for China and Gyaser for Russia) and Phagyul are Tibetan names for India. Ancient Tibetan Buddhist authors and pilgrims used the ethnogeographic referents Gyagar or Gyagar to the south and Madhyadesa (central land or holy centre) for India. Since at least 13th century, several influential indigenous Tibetan lamas & authors also started to refer to India as the Phagyul, short for Phags yul, meaning the land of aryas i.e. land of noble, holy, enlightened & superior people who are the source of spiritual enlightenment.[42] Tibetan scholar Gendun Chopel explains that Tibetan word gyagar comes from the Indian sanskrit language word vihāra (buddhist monastery), and the ancient Tibetans applied the term Geysar mainly to the northern and central India region from Kuru (modern Haryana) to Magadha (modern Bihar).[43] The Epic of King Gesar, which originally developed around 200 BCE or 300 BCE and about 600 CE, describes India as the \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Buddhist Doctrine\", \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Aru Medicine\" (ayurveda), \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Pearls\" and \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Golden Vases\".[44] The Central Tibetan Administration, often referred to as the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, asserts \"Tibet is inextricably linked to India through geography, history, culture, and spiritually, Tibetans refer to India as ‘Gyagar Phagpay Yul’ or ‘India the land of Aryas.’\" Dalai Lama reveres India as the guru with Tibet as its chela (shishya or disciple) and \"refers to himself the ‘Son of India’ and a true follower of Mahatma Gandhi. He continues to advocate the revival of India\\'s ancient wisdom based on the Nalanda tradition.\"[45]\\n\\nTianzhu\\nMain article: Tianzhu (India)\\nTiānzhú (Chinese: 天竺 originally pronounced *qʰl\\'iːn tuɡ) is one of several Chinese transliterations of the Sanskrit Sindhu via Persian Hindu[46] and is used since ancient times in China and its peripheries. Its Sino-Xenic reading is Tenjiku in Japanese, Cheonchuk (천축) in Korean, and Thiên Trúc in Vietnamese. Devout Buddhists in the Sinosphere traditionally used this term and its related forms to designate India as their \"heavenly centre\", referring to the sacred origins of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent.[47][48]\\n\\nOther forms include Juāndú (身毒), which appears in Sima Qian\\'s Shiji. Another is Tiāndǔ (天篤), which is used in the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han).[49] Yìntèjiā or Indəkka (印特伽) comes from the Kuchean Indaka, another transliteration of Hindu.[46]\\n\\nA detailed account of Tianzhu is given in the \"Xiyu Zhuan\" (Record of the Western Regions) in the Hou Hanshu compiled by Fan Ye (398–445):\\n\\nThe state of Tianzhu: Also named Shendu, it lies several thousand li southeast of Yuezhi. Its customs are the same as those of Yuezhi, and it is low, damp, and very hot. It borders a large river. The inhabitants ride on elephants in warfare; they are weaker than the Yuezhi. They practise the way of Futu (the Buddha), [and therefore] it has become a custom among them not to kill or attack [others]. From west of the states Yuezhi and Gaofu, and south until the Western Sea, and east until the state of Panqi, all is the territory of Shendu. Shendu has several hundred separate towns, with a governor, and separate states which can be numbered in the tens, each with its own king. Although there are small differences among them, they all come under the general name of Shendu, and at this time all are subject to Yuezhi. Yuezhi have killed their kings and established a general in order to rule over their people. The land produces elephants, rhinoceros, tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin. It communicates to the west with Da Qin and (so) has the exotica of Da Qin.[49]\\n\\nTianzhu was also referred to as Wǔtiānzhú (五天竺, literally \"Five Indias\"), because there were five geographical regions in India known to the Chinese: Central, Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern India. The monk Xuanzang also referred to India as Wǔ Yìn or \"Five Inds\".[46]\\n\\nThe name Tianzhu and its Sino-Xenic cognates were eventually replaced by terms derived from the Middle Chinese borrowing of *yentu from Kuchean, though a very long time elapsed between that term\\'s first use and its becoming the standard modern name for India in East Asian languages. Pronounced Yìndù (Chinese: 印度) in Chinese, it was first used by the seventh-century monk and traveler Xuanzang.[50] In Japanese for example, the name Indo (インド, 印度, or occasionally 印土) had been found occasionally in 18th and early 19th-century works, such as Arai Hakuseki\\'s Sairan Igen (1713) and Yamamura Saisuke [ja]\\'s Indoshi (印度志, a translation of a work by Johann Hübner). However, the use of the name Tenjiku, which was heavily associated with the image of India as a land of Buddhism, was not completely displaced until the early 20th century: scholars such as Soyen Shaku and Seki Seisetsu [ja] who travelled to India for pilgrimages to Buddhist historical sites, continued to use the name Tenjiku to emphasise the religious aspect of their travels, though most of their contemporaries (even fellow Buddhist pilgrims) adopted the name Indo by then.[51][52]\\n\\nIndia is nowadays also called Indo (인도) in Korean, and Ấn Độ in Vietnamese. Similar to Hindu and Sindhu, the term Yin was used in classical Chinese much like the English Ind.\\n\\nHodu\\nHodu (Hebrew: הֹדּוּ Hodû) is the Biblical Hebrew name for India mentioned in the Book of Esther part of the Jewish Tanakh and Christian Old Testament. In Esther, 1:1 and 8:9,[53] Ahasuerus had been described as King ruling 127 provinces from Hodu (India) to Ethiopia.[54] The term seemingly derives from Sanskrit Sindhu, \"great river\", i.e., the Indus River, via Old Persian Hiñd°u.[55] It is thus cognate with the term India.\\n\\nHistorical names\\nSome historical definitions prior to 1500 are presented below.[56]\\n\\nYear\\tName\\tSource\\tDefinition\\nc. 440 BCE\\tIndia\\tHerodotus\\t\"Eastward of India lies a tract which is entirely sand.

It is not still called Taurus in this land; but Taurus begins from the sea over against Pamphylia and Lycia and Cilicia; and reaches as far as the Eastern Ocean, running right across Asia. But the mountain has different names in different places; in one, Parapamisus, in another Hemodus; elsewhere it is called Imaon and perhaps has all sorts of other names; but the Macedonians who fought with Alexander called it Caucasus; another Caucasus, that is, not the Scythian; so that the story ran that Alexander came even to the far side of the Caucasus. The western part of India is bounded by the river Indus right down to the ocean, where the river runs out by two mouths, not joined as are the five mouths of the Ister; but like those of the Nile, by which the Egyptian delta is formed; thus also the Indian delta is formed by the river Indus, not less than the Egyptian; and this in the Indian tongue is called Pattala. Towards the south this ocean bounds the land of India, and eastward the sea itself is the boundary. The southern part near Pattala and the mouths of the Indus were surveyed by Alexander and Macedonians and many Greeks; as for the eastern part, Alexander did not traverse this beyond the river Hyphasis. A few historians have described the parts which are this side of the Ganges and where are the mouths of the Ganges and the city of Palimbothra, the greatest Indian city on the Ganges.(...) The Indian rivers are greater than any others in Asia; greatest are the Ganges and the Indus, whence the land gets its name; each of these is greater than the Nile of Egypt and the Scythian Ister, even were these put together; my own idea is that even the Acesines is greater than the Ister and the Nile, where the Acesines having taken in the Hydaspes, Hydraotes, and Hyphasis, runs into the Indus, so that its breadth there becomes thirty stades. Possibly also other greater rivers run through the land of India.\"\\nc. 650\\tFive Indies\\tXuanzang\\t\"The circumference of 五印 (Modern Chinese: Wǔ Yìn, the Five Indies) is about 90,000 li; on three sides it is bounded by a great sea; on the north it is backed by snowy mountains.

## Vector Database
    - A storage unit to store the embeddings generated by LLMs
    - Workings: Text --> Embeddings (LLM) --> Vector DB (Bigger) --> Search
    - Different vector databases available:
        - chromaDB - https://www.trychroma.com/
        - pinecone - https://www.pinecone.io/
        - weaviate - https://weaviate.io/

## chromaDB
    - chroma is open source
    - Start by installtion: ```pip install chromadb```
    - Run this command to start the chromaDB server locally:
        ```python
            chroma run --path ./chromadb_data
        ```
    - Start with client to check connection with the vector db
    - Create a collection to store all the vectors (embedded)
    - Define doc, convert it to embeddings using any LLM, write these details into vector db collection
    - Once embeddings are generated and stored, search for any text by first converting it to embedding and then querying the vector db collection

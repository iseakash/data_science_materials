## Vector Database
- A storage unit to store the embeddings generated by LLMs
- Workings: Text --> Embeddings (LLM) --> Vector DB (Bigger) --> Search
- Different vector databases available:
    - FAISS 
    - chromaDB - https://www.trychroma.com/
    - pinecone - https://www.pinecone.io/
    - weaviate - https://weaviate.io/
    - qdrant - https://qdrant.tech/

## chromaDB
- chroma is open source
- Start by installtion: 
```pip install chromadb```
- Run this command to start the chromaDB server locally:
```chroma run --path ./chromadb_data```
- Start with client to check connection with the vector db
- Create a collection to store all the vectors (embedded)
- Define doc, convert it to embeddings using any LLM, write these details into vector db collection
- Once embeddings are generated and stored, search for any text by first converting it to embedding and then querying the vector db collection

## FAISS
- faiss is open source and is developed by facebook
- Start by installation:
```pip install faiss-cpu```

## Qdrant
- Create a free cluster with any name, which will be ready in 2-3 minutes
- Save the API key and the usage example in python
- Start by installation:
```pip install qdrant_client```
- Run ```qdrant_client``` in terminal or jupyter cell to see if it is working or not
- Recreate the collection with defined configuration like vector size, similarity search type, etc
- Prepare data (embeddings & metadata) into point list and upset into the collection (table)
- Convery the user query into embeddings and return top search items
